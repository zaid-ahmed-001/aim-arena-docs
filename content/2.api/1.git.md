# Git

Git is a version control system, allowing changes to be effectively tracked, merged, and reverted.

As our resources are hosted on GitHub, it can be incredibly useful to learn how to create your own repository to track changes and keep up-to-date. If you plan on making your own changes to our resources, this will allow you to keep your own changes and prevent loss of data.

- Refer to [GitHub's guide to setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git).
- You can use a Git GUI client like [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to improve your workflow and more easily maintain changes.
