# pnpm

pnpm is a fast and disk space efficient package manager, serving as an alternative to npm and yarn.

- Ensure you have [installed Node.js](./nodejs).
- Open a command-line terminal (e.g. Terminal, Command Prompt).
- Enter `npm install -g pnpm` to globally install the package.
- You can install dependencies with pnpm using `pnpm i`.

You can reference `package.json` files for available scripts, i.e.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "vite",
  "watch": "vite build --watch",
  "build": "tsc && vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "format": "prettier --write \"./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,css}\""
},
```

Using the example above `pnpm build` will run the build script for the given package.
